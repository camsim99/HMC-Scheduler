  TODO we need class dependancy tracking! (indexed by classes?)
** Option 1
   define a set of prereqs indexed over courses, and then have a constraint
   which uses the sum of these courses (S[c in Classes]

   -----

   I like the set idea, because (a) it will be easier to type and (b) we can use
   AMPL's subset feature to ensure each prereq set will be a subset of the
   course set.  Note that this DOES NOT allow for any logical ORs in dependancy
   tracking.

   TODO are there any instances of courses which have logical OR in their
   prereqs.
** Option 2
   We can also use a matrix of all ones, and then have zeros (would not be
   symetric).  [i,j] represents whether course i depends on course j

   to generalize AND, use CS70 <= prerequisite
